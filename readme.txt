Chrome Extension - Retailers v2.0

Description
The "Retailers" Chrome extension allows you to create and manage a list of Retailers. You can import a website list from a CSV file and search for retailers by name or ID.

Instructions

1. Installing the Extension
Download the folder with the extension's source code from this repository.
Open Google Chrome and type chrome://extensions in the address bar.
Enable the developer mode located in the upper right corner.
Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder with the extension's source code.
The "Retailers" extension should appear in the list of installed extensions. Make sure it is enabled.
Then import the attached .csv file and you can start using the extension.

2. Managing a Website List
Prepare a CSV file containing the website list (already attached with .zip).
Open the extension by clicking on its icon in the upper right corner of the browser.
Click the "Import CSV File" button.
Choose the CSV file with the website list in the file dialog.
After importing, the websites will be displayed in the extension interface.

You can also remove the list from the memory of the extensions - just click a "Delete Imported CSV file".

Once you see there is a new retailer and you want to add it to the extension, you just create a CSV file with this retailer only (or in the further version of the extension - you can just input a new retailer to the existing file), and then import to the extension.

3. Searching for Websites
To search for a website, enter the name in the search bar at the top of the extension interface.
The list of websites will be filtered in real-time as you type, showing only the matching results.

4. TODO:
- To add the funcionality of adding single pages just by putting the retailer ID, retailername, and stack (these are the factors that create the URL)
